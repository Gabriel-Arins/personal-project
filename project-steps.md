# Project Steps for Web System with Docker on GCP

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Structure
- Create a project directory with subdirectories for source code, Docker files, Terraform configurations, and documentation.

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
- Define your application in a `Dockerfile` to containerize it.

## Step 3: Create a Docker Compose File (Optional)
- Use Docker Compose for managing multiple services.

## Step 4: Write Terraform Configuration
- Set up Terraform in the `terraform/` directory to define GCP infrastructure.

## Step 5: Write Deployment Scripts
- Create scripts for building Docker images, pushing to a container registry, and deploying with Terraform.

## Step 6: Document Your Project
- Update `README.md` with instructions on building, running, and deploying your application.

## Step 7: Initialize and Deploy
- Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create infrastructure in GCP.

## Step 8: Test Your Application
- Access your application using the assigned external IP or domain name.

## Step 9: Set Up CI/CD
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

## Step 10: Monitoring and Logging
- Integrate monitoring (e.g., Google Cloud Monitoring) and logging (e.g., Google Cloud Logging) to track application performance and logs.
